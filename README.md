## Abstract
#### Metric 1: Safety
Police incidents are counted per neighborhood and weighed based on their severity in order to determine the danger of the neighborhood.
Those counts are then divided by estimated populations for those neighborhoods, giving us an indicator of which neighborhoods are the most dangerous, as well as which are the most safe.

Based on this metric, the top 3 safest neighborhoods are as follows:

#### Metric 2: Public Art
1. New Homestead
2. Regent Square
3. Squirrel Hill North

 TODO --- Abstract: A TLDR summary of the findings of the project. Answer to the question: What is the best neighborhood? And How did you determine that answer (brief summary of metrics)t
 
 #### Conclusion
 Based on both metrics, with 2/3 weight given to the safety metric and 1/3 weight given to the art metric, the top 3 best neighborhoods are as follows:
1. Squirrel Hill South
2. Highland Park
3. Shadyside
