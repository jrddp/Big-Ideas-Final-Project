## Abstract
#### Metric 1: Safety
Police incidents are counted per neighborhood and weighed based on their severity in order to determine the danger of the neighborhood.
Those counts are then divided by estimated populations for those neighborhoods, giving us an indicator of which neighborhoods are the most dangerous, as well as which are the most safe.

Based on this metric, the top 3 safest neighborhoods are as follows:
1. New Homestead
2. Regent Square
3. Squirrel Hill North

#### Metric 2: Public Art

Each neighborhood was counted for each time it was listed in the dataset. The neighborhood that was listed the most, or had the most public art, is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

Based on this metric, the top 3 neighborhoods are:
1. Central Business District
2. Squirrel Hill South
3. Allegheny Center

#### Conclusion
Based on both metrics, with 2/3 weight given to the safety metric and 1/3 weight given to the art metric, the top 3 best neighborhoods are as follows:
1. Squirrel Hill South
2. Highland Park
3. Shadyside
